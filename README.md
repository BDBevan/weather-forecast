# Weather-Forecast Challenge

This is the initial weather forecast page. It allows users to search for current weather by typing in a city name into the search input box. It will then display a weather forecast for the next 5 days of the selected city. Search critera is retained to local storage so that the city's searched are still listed when the page is refreshed. 


## Features

- Allows users to search current and 5 day forecast of weather in the desired city.
- Will provide a list of previously searched city's, which can be clicked on at a later time to revel current weather data for the selected city.
- Will retain previously searched items in local storage for re-visiting.
